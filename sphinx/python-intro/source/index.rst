Preface
=======

This book is to teach students how program in ``Python``. To follow along and execute the code samples, you will need `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ installed. The Docker container is located on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/oneoffcoder/book-python-intro>`_. After you have installed Docker, you may run the container as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -it \
    -p 8888:8888 \

Note that this Docker container has `Jupyter Lab <https://jupyter.org/>`_ running on port ``8888``. You may access Jupyter Lab at `http://localhost:8888 <http://localhost:8888>`_ when the Docker container is running.
