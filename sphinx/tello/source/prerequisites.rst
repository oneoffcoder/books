Prerequisites
=============

To program the Tello drone, you will need a few key pieces of software.

* `Adobe Air <https://get.adobe.com/air/>`_
* `Scratch <https://scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/sa/Scratch-461.exe>`_
* `NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_
* `Tello Extension <https://dl-cdn.ryzerobotics.com/downloads/tello/20180222/Scratch.zip>`_

You will need to install these software in the order given above. Note the following.

* ``Adobe Air`` is required by ``Scratch`` to work.
* The offline version of ``Scratch 2.0`` is required (the latest is ``Scratch 3.0``).
* ``NodeJS`` version 12 or higher should work.
* The ``Tello Extension`` contains files that has a ``plugin`` for Scratch and a NodeJS ``script`` that enables your program/Scratch to connect to the drone.
