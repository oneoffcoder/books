Scratch
=======

Here are some very basic programs you may try for yourself to start drone programming with Scratch and the Tello!

Hello, World!
-------------

Every programming attempt needs a ``Hello, world!`` example. This program simply lifts up the drone and tells it to land again.

Going up and down
-----------------

This program sends the drone up and then down.

Left or right?
--------------

This program makes the drone fly left then right.

Forward, then backward
----------------------

This program flies the drone forward then backward.

Turning around and around
-------------------------

How about rotating the drone clocwise ``cw`` then counter-clockwise ``ccw``?

Flipping out
------------

Can we make the drone flip out?

Manual Control
--------------

Can we manually control the drone? ``YES, WE CAN!``. Note the following.

- ``up arrow`` flies forward
- ``down arrow`` flies backward
- ``left arrow`` flies left
- ``right arrow`` flies right
- ``q`` makes the drone take off
- ``w`` lands the drone
- ``a`` rotates the drone clockwise by 45 degrees
- ``s`` rotates the drone counter-clockwise by 45 degrees

Spicy Manual Control
--------------------

Let's spice it up with manual controls! Sounds + motion with the cat!
