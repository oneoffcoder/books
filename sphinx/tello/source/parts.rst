Props
-----

The ``propellers`` or ``props`` are used to create roll, pitch and yaw. Note that there are 2 types of props, clockwise ``CW`` and counter-clockwise ``CCW``. The CCW props have ``notches`` while the CW props do not. On every Tello, you should have 2 CW and 2 CCW props, and they should be placed diagonal from each other. With the Tello laying down and the battery facing towards your body and the camera facing away, the top-left and bottom-right props should be CCW props, and the top-right and bottom-left props should be CW props.
