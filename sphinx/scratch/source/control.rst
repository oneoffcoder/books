Control
=======

Control code blocks are responsibile for directing the flow of your code and program.

Waiting
-------

You may force your program to wait.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/00-wait.png

    This code block forces your program to wait for a specified amount of seconds.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/05-wait-until.png

    This code block forces your program to wait until a ``termination`` condition is satisified.

Loops
-----

To make your program repeat something over and over, use the following loops.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/01-repeat.png

    This code block repeats code for the specified amount of time.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/02-forever.png

    This code block repeats code forever.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/06-repeat-until.png

    This code block repeats code until a ``termination`` condition is satisified.

Conditionals
------------

Conditionals are responsible for decisions.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/03-if.png

    This code block executes code only if the specified condition is satisfied.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/04-if-else.png

    This code block executes one of two code blocks.

Stopping
--------

You may stop your program using the following code blocks.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/07-stop-all.png

    This code block stops all code.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/08-stop-this-script.png

    This code block stops the specified script.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/09-stop-sprites.png

    This code block stops other scripts.

Clones
------

You may also listen for clone events. Cloning is the act of copying and creating a new object from another.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/10-when-i-start-as-clone.png

    This code block listens for when an object starts as a clone.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/11-clone.png

    This code block creates a clone.

.. figure:: _static/images/control/12-delete-clone.png

    This code block deletes a clone.
