Custom Blocks
=============

Custom blocks is where you may ``abstract`` your code blocks into a logical unit. Custom blocks may help for a variety of reasons as follows.

- your code will be more concise (shorter code)
- you will be able to think more ``declaratively`` as opposed to ``procedurally``
- you will be able to ``reuse`` your custom blocks throughout your program
