    This code block detects when two specified colors are touching.

Distance
--------

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/03-distance-to-mouse-pointer.png

    This code block detects the distance to the specified object (for example, ``mouse pointer``).

Asking
------

You may get input from users.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/04-ask-name-wait.png

Keys
----

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/05-key-space-pressed.png

    This code block senses when the ``space bar`` is pressed.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/06-key-up-pressed.png

    This code block senses when the ``up arrow`` is pressed.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/07-key-down-pressed.png

    This code block senses when the ``down arrow`` is pressed.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/08-key-right-pressed.png

    This code block senses when the ``right arrow`` is pressed.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/09-key-left-pressed.png

    This code block senses when the ``left arrow`` is pressed.

Mouse
-----

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/10-mouse-down.png

    This code block senses if the mouse is pressed down.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/11-mouse-x.png

    This code block senses the ``x`` coordinate of the mouse.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/12-mouse-y.png

    This code block senses the ``y`` coordinate of the mouse.

Drag
----

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/19-set-drag-mode.png

    This code block sets the drag mode.

Timer
-----

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/13-reset-timer.png

    This code block resets the timer.

Stage
-----

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/14-backdrop-number-stage.png

    This code block senses the backdrop of the stage. For example, is it the first, second, third, and so on backdrop?

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/15-backdrop-name-stage.png

    This code block senses the backdrop name of the stage.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/16-volume-stage.png

    This code block senses the volume of the stage.

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/17-my-variable-stage.png

    This code block senses the specified variable of the stage.

Days
----

.. figure:: _static/images/sensing/18-days-since-2000.png

    This code block senses the number of days since the year ``2000``.
